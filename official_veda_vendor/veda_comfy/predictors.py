"""The released predictor bundles: where they live and how to get them.

Metadata only. This module performs no network access and reads no
environment: the predictor reaches `models/veda` either through ComfyUI's
own missing-model dialog, which the example workflows drive with
`properties.models`, or because the user put the file there. The node
turns a missing file into an error that says exactly where to get it (see
`nodes._predictor_path`).

That is a deliberate narrowing. An earlier version fetched the bundle
itself over plain HTTPS, resuming and verifying its digest. It worked,
but a custom node that opens connections and reads an auth token out of
the environment trips the Comfy Registry's security scan, and fetching
models is something ComfyUI already does for us. See
docs/features/packaging_release.md.

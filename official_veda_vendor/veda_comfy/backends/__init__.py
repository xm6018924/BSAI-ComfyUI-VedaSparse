"""Backend registry: which kernel runs on which device.

    CUDA sm80 and up    triton-int8
    Apple MPS           mlx
    anything else       nothing (the node runs the model's own attention)

One kernel per device family, no fallback chain and nothing for the user
to pick. Earlier there were five: four FA4 CuTe backends (one per SM
family, plus an FP8 variant) behind a FlexAttention and a plain-torch
path. `triton-int8` replaced all of them because it is better on every
axis that mattered - 1.50x the FA4 kernel's speed on the same sparse
problem, the same accuracy as ComfyUI's own low-precision attention, and
SM80-and-up coverage from a single Triton kernel - and because a chain of
fallbacks silently hands a user a slower or less accurate kernel than the
one they think they are running. See docs/features/int8_kernel.md.

Backend modules are imported lazily and only here, so a missing Triton
costs one line in the report, never the node.
